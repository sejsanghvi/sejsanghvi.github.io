  <h3>Subjectivity and Anonymity:</h3>

  <p>Platforms like "Rate My Professor" struggle with subjectivity due to user anonymity, allowing biased and unfair evaluations. Lack of accountability leads to inconsistent, unverified feedback, undermining student trust in information accuracy.</p>
</div>

<div class="column-two">
<h3>Incomplete Professor Evaluation:</h3>

  <p>Existing platforms often lack a comprehensive view of a professor's teaching abilities due to a lack of standardized evaluation processes. This inconsistency makes it challenging for students to form a balanced understanding of a professor's performance.
  </p>
</div> 


  <div class="column-two">
  <h3>Insufficient Course Information:</h3>

  <p>Platforms such as "Rate My Courses" at NYU may lack specific course details, hindering students from understanding classes fully. Limited insights into teaching styles and overall academic experiences leave students without crucial information for informed course selections.</p>
</div>

<div class="column-two">
<h3>Need for a Tailored and Reliable Solution:</h3>

  <p>Addressing these challenges requires a robust platform offering accurate, detailed insights into professors and courses. Prioritizing transparency, accountability, and standardized evaluation methods, this solution aims to empower students with reliable information for informed academic decisions.</p>
