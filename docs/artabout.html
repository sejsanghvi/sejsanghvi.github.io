    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
    <p>I am an India-born, New York-based artist who creates installations, projections, and social art as an intersection of mindfulness and art. My work investigates bodily experiences that lead to insights. I am interested in creating experiences and practices that make us aware of consciousness.</p>
    <p>For me, inner freedom is the most important thing. When the body is in repetition, the body transcends to the state of awareness. Using repetitive acts, I materialize consciousness in installation art by framing various sets of instructions for the body to perform. In my practice, I prioritize the visitor's inner experience over physical objects, which lets viewers engage in silent conversations with themselves.</p>
    <p>My work explores the tension between detachment and engagement. The key to opening the door to inner freedom comes from a singular concept: presence. By being present in the moment, Here and Now, transformation can be achieved.</p>
