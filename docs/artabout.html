        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>
          I am an India-born, New York-based artist who creates installations,
          projections, and social art as an intersection of mindfulness and art.
          My work investigates bodily experiences that lead to insights. I am
          interested in creating experiences and practices that make us aware of
          consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, inner freedom is the most important thing. When the body is
          in repetition, the body transcends to the state of awareness. Using
          repetitive acts, I materialize consciousness in installation art by
          framing various sets of instructions for the body to perform. In my
          practice, I prioritize the visitor's inner experience over physical
          objects, which lets viewers engage in silent conversations with
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work explores the tension between detachment and engagement. The
          key to opening the door to inner freedom comes from a singular concept:
          presence. By being present in the moment, Here and Now, transformation
          can be achieved.
